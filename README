Back-End organization:

After considering options for how to handle back-end interaction from front-end:
1 - stick things into appDelegate (already a singleton)
2 - create singleton "manager" objects
3 - dependency injection by passing pointer to "manager" down
, I went with 2.

After considering how to have front-end respond to changes in back-end:
1 - stick update functions into appDelegate
2 - pass object conforming to callback protocol from front to back-end
3 - create intermediate object responsible for updating front-end, pass to back-end
, I went with 2.



In general:
View sets up the UI,
View's UI callbacks is received by ViewController,
ViewController calls Managers, passing something as callback (view, or controller),
Manager does something, runs callback.

This way, the back-end managers (data management) is completely separate from front-end.
Front-end is tied to each-other since View uses appDelegate to find ViewController.
